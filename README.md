# Friday Night Funkin' - Newbie's Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Newbie's Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/), intended to be a fork of Psych Engine.

## Installation:

Refer to [the Build Instructions](./BUILDING.md)

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`

inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file
